# Straight Skeleton
Simple straight skeleton generator for Unity3D/C#.

Can generate a straight skeleton from any set of points describing a simple polygon (e.g. no incident vertices, no self-intersection, no holes etc.).

The package contains a small sample scene with a building generator to demonstrate the algorithm.
